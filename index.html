<h2>1. Love Yourself</h2>
<u>Justin Bieber</u>
<P><ul type="none" start="1">
<li>For all the times that you rain on my parade</li>
<li>And all the clubs you get in using my name</li>
<li>You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake</li>
<li>You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't</li></p>
<p><li>And I didn't wanna write a song</li>
<li>Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care</li>
<li>I don't but, you still hit my phone up</li>
<li>And baby I be movin' on</li></p>
<p><li>And I think you should be somethin'</li>
<li>I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that</li>
<li>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone</li>
<li>And I never like to admit that I was wrong</li></p>
<P><li>And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on</li>
<li>But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</li>
<li>Cause if you like the way you look that much</li>
<li>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself</li></p>
<p><li>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</li>
<li>You should go and love yourself</li>
<li>And when you told me that you hated my friends</li>
<li>The only problem was with you and not them</li></p>
<p><li>And every time you told me my opinion was wrong</li>
<li>And tried to make me forget where I came from</li>
<li>And I didn't wanna write a song</li>
<li>Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care</li></p>
<p><li>I don't but, you still hit my phone up</li>
<li>And baby I be movin' on</li>
<li>And I think you should be somethin'</li>
<li>I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that</li></p>
<P><li>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone</li>
<li>And I never like to admit that I was wrong</li>
<li>And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on</li>
<li>But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</li></p>
<p><li>Cause if you like the way you look that much</li>
<li>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself</li>
<li>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</li>
<li>You should go and love yourself</li></p>
<p><li>For all the times that you made me feel small</li>
<li>I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all</li>
<li>Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable</li>
<li>Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</li></p>
<p><li>Cause if you like the way you look that much</li>
<li>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself</li>
<li>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</li>
<li>You should go and love yourself</li></p>
<p><li>Cause if you like the way you look that much</li>
<li>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself</li>
<li>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'</li>
<li>You should go and love yourself</li></p>
